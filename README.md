# Investigating-Parody-from-Social-Media-Accounts
Parody is a widespread comic on different
social media platforms. As the usage of social media
increases, the number of parody accounts increases as
well. The main purpose of parody accounts is to spread
fake news or to criticize someone in comic ways. In this
paper, we investigate parody for different social media
accounts. For this study, a customized tweets dataset is
created related to different Pakistani personalities and
companies. The experiment is carried out using different
machine learning and deep learning methods. Our results
indicate an accuracy of 92% using RoBERTa.
